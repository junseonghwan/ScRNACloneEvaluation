# Code for evaluating ScRNA Clone experiments

This repository deposits code developed to compare our method (**TODO: link**) to [ddClone](https://github.com/sohrabsa/ddclone/) and [B-SCITE](https://github.com/smalikic/B-SCITE).

+ B-SCITE depends on CPLEX. We used version 12.8.
+ [VAFclusterEMpackage](https://github.com/smalikic/B-SCITE/tree/master/VAFclusterEMpackage/VAFclusterEM) is extended with the feature to extract clones from mutation tree.
